<p>Cathay O Neil’s highly informative expose “Weapon of Mass Destruction” sheds much-needed light on the subject of how math was used to form models to predict patterns and consequences in every area of our lives.<br>
Math along with computer technology has been used to gather data and create profiles that are not truly helpful to ordinary people in their daily lives and O Neil gives us many examples of how these models have worked to the detriment of our humanity.<br>
She explains the algorithm that is so valuable to Google, Amazon, and Facebook and the danger and the harm done by the statistical systems like the LSIR which qualify as WMD because the way it is structured is self-sustaining.<br>
O’Neil to her credit is quick to point out that not all WMD are completely destructive as there are some individuals who do benefit from them, but it is the fact that there are so many who don’t benefit and who are made to suffer is what makes this practice so unfair. <br>
 O’Neil gave some of the best examples of what qualifies as a WMD in a technical sense from prisons to college applicants and job seekers as well as credit risks to predicting where a crime may occur with models like PredPol.</p>

 <p>There are three identifying markers identified as elements of WMD, Opacity, Scale, and Damage:<br>
<p>Opacity - Not transparent or hard to understand<br>
Scale - Contains factors for unlimited growth to cause harm to the majority<br>
Damage - Implementation of WMD causes universal harm to humanity </p>

<p>But another type or example that would qualify as a WMD is the way human beings are judged and evaluated, selected, or rejected based on the models utilized and regarded as physically appealing such as skin color, facial characteristics, and body structures.
